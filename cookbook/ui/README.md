# UI

We have focused on making a user interface that makes the cookbook easy to use. There is two scenes in this project. The scene where the user can **log in or register** for the cookbook, and a **cookbook** scene where all the rest of the functionality is managed. The FXML files is generated by help from JavaFX scene builder.   
We use panes in the cookbook scene to make it fast and easy to change the objects that should be visible on the screen. for example if the user wants to get a random recipe, than the "addNewRecipePane" should not be visible.
