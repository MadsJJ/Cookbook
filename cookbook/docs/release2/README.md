The official website: https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml

You also need to install Graphviz. Go to https://graphviz.org/download/ for instructions on how to download on your computer.

For description of what the packages contains, view 
[README.md](README.md).
### The interactions between the packages
[core](cookbook/core/src/main/java/core) may interact with the external librarie as Jackson, for data processing with JSON. 

[ui](cookbook/ui) relies on the javafx component for creating the graphical interface. It will also interact with core, to fetch and display data from the logic.

The javafx component is essential when creating the graphical UI. It will load UI resources from the [ui](cookbook/ui) package.

This architecture separates the core logic, user interface, and data handling components. It allows flexible development, and makes it easier to update or replace specific parts of the system without affecting the entire Cookbook application.

## Work habits and workflow
We have been focusing on the following aspects while working on release 2.  

1. **Pair Programming:** We are using pair programming approach. Where two developers collaborate on the same computer. The name of the co-author is written in the commit message. Pair programming makes it easier to share knowledge, and helps us identify and address issues more efficiently.
2. **GitLab Issues:** We use GitLab issues to identify and track our work. Each task or feature begins as an issue.
3. **Branch-Based Development:** To manage and isolate all coding tasks, we use branches. Each task or feature is developed on its own branch. This allows us to work on multiple aspects of the project simultaneously without interfering with each other's code.
4. **Active Group Discussions:** We engage in group discussions whenever we encounter challenges during the development process. This makes it faster to solve the problem, and the knowledge is shared among the whole team.
5. **Milestones** We use milestones to track the issues we have for release 2. This helps to organize the work and the projectÂ´s progress.
