# User Stories

We wanted to expand the functionality of the Cookbook application. In releace 3 the users will be able filter the recepies by the ingredients that they already have in the fridge. The following user story will map out core functionality and necessities. Based on the user story, we also made UI design prototypes which can be found here:

## User Story 2

As a private person I am unsure of what to make for dinner. To save money, and avoid having to throw away food, I want to use some of the ingredients that i already have at home. I wish to know what recipes I can make out of those ingredients.

### Important to see:

- A field to input the ingredients available to the user.
- A list of recipes compatible with the input of ingredients.
- A list of the ingredients from which to filter the recepies from. 


### Important Functionality:

- The application needs an input field for the available ingredients that supports the input of multiple recipes at a time.
- From the given ingredients a list of all recipes containing those ingredients needs to be made visible.
- The list implemented needs the same functionality as the list containing all recipes so that the design is consistent.
- The application needs to be able to add and remove ingredients that the user wants to filter the recepies by.
- The filtering of the recepies will be done by a method in Coocbook class.
