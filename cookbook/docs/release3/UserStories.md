## User Story 2

As a private person I am unsure of what to make for dinner. I have a list of ingredients available in my kitchen and I wish to know what recipes I can make out of those ingredients. 

### Important to see:

- A field to input the ingredients available to the user.
- A list of recipes compatible with the input of ingredients.
- A list of the ingredients from which to filter the recepies from. 


### Important Functionality:

- The application needs an input field for the available ingredients that supports the input of multiple recipes at a time.
- From the given ingredients a list of all recipes containing those ingredients needs to be made visible.
- The list implemented needs the same functionality as the list containing all recipes so that the design is consistent.
- The application needs to be able to add and remove ingredients that the user wants to filter the recepies by.
- The filtering of the recepies will be done by a method in Coocbook class.
