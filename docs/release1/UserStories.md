# User Stories

Before creating our first release we made user stories to map out core functionality and necessities. Based on the user stories, we also made UI design prototypes which can be found here:

> - [CookBookPrototype](UIPrototypes/CookBookPrototype.jpg)
> - [CookBookAddPrototype](UIPrototypes/CookBookAddPrototype.jpg)

## User Story 1

As a private person I am unsure of what to make for dinner. Therefore I require inspiration for what I can make.

The user needs the ability to get an interactive list of previously created recipes so that the user can scroll down and find the desired recipe to cook.

### Important To See:

- When requesting the recipes a list of available recipes has to be shown.
- The list has to be easy to understand and efficient.

### Important Functionality:

- The list has to appear instantly by the press of a button.
- The recipes should be displayed vertically in a list, so that navigating between the recipes is easy.
- The user needs the ability to scroll down to the bottom of the list, so that the entire list is available to be viewed.

## User Story 2

As a private person I am unsure of what to make for dinner. I have a list of ingredients available in my kitchen and I wish to know what recipes I can make out of those ingredients. 

### Important to see:

- A field to input the ingredients available to the user.
- A list of recipes compatible with the input of ingredients.

### Important Functionality:

- The application needs an input field for the available ingredients that supports the input of multiple recipes at a time.
- From the given ingredients a list of all recipes containing those ingredients needs to be made visible.
- The list implemented needs the same functionality as the list containing all recipes so that the design is consistent.
