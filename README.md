# Cookbook

## Description
This is a cookbook app created for your personal use. You can use it to store and look at your favorite recipes at your convenience. If you are not sure about what meal to cook, you can get recipe suggestions based on what type of meal you want.

## Application fundementals

The project uses maven to build and to run. Below is 3 different step-by-step-guides to use Cookbook

Java-version: 17.0.8
Maven-version: 3.9.2 

To run in **Eclipse che** follow this step-by-step:
1. Set up your eclipse che account with an access token
2. Follow [Open in Eclipse Che](https://che.stud.ntnu.no/#https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/groups-2023/gr2308/gr2308?new) 
3. Run `mvn clean install` from the root project directory (cookbook-folder). This will build the project and run all tests (to skip tests add `-DskipTests`).
4. Run `cd restserver && mvn spring-boot:run` to launch spring boot. (or run `cd restserver` followed by `mvn spring-boot:run`)
5. Run  `mvn javafx:run -f ui/pom.xml` to launch the application (or run `cd ui` followed by `mvn javafx:run`)
6. Look in endpoint for the 6080-link and paste it into your preferred browser and add /cookbook at the end
7. Log-in or sign up to create your very own personal cookbook!

To run the application as normal in your IDE follow this step-by-step:
1. Run `mvn clean install` from the root project directory (cookbook-folder). This will build the project and run all tests (to skip tests add `-DskipTests`).
2. Run  `mvn javafx:run -f ui/pom.xml` to launch the program (or run `cd ui` followed by `mvn javafx:run`)
3. Log-in or sign up to create your very own personal cookbook!

To run the application with **jlink and jpackage** follow this step-by-step:
1. Run `mvn clean install` from the root project directory (cookbook-folder). This will build the project and run all tests (to skip tests add `-DskipTests`).
2. Run `cd restserver && mvn spring-boot:run` to launch spring boot (or run `cd restserver` followed by `mvn spring-boot:run`)
3. Run  `cd ui && mvn clean compile javafx:jlink jpackage:jpackage`. JLink downloads the project as a .zip-file and JPackage convertes it to an "application". To find the .zip-file look in */ui/target*
4. Find the application and open it as you would any other application on your computer. 
5. Log-in or sign up to create your very own personal cookbook!
