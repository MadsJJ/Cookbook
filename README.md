# Cookbook

## Description
This is a cookbook app created for your personal use. You can use it to store and look at your favorite recipes at your convenience. If you are not sure about what meal to cook, you can get recipe suggestions based on what type of meal you want and your currently available ingredients. 

## Application fundementals
The project uses maven to build and to run

Java-version: 17.0.8
Maven-version: 3.9.2 

To run the application run `mvn install` from the root (cookbook-folder). This will build the project and run all tests. Afterwards run `cd ui` to get to the ui-folder, followed by `mvn javafx:run` to run the program.

## Implicit Saving

Whenever you log into Cookbook, your recipes will be right there - instantly. No need to look through files and folders.
